# TournamentPlanner

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.

With the idea of building a functional productivity app that aligns with our interest, we created the Tournament Planner App. It lets you organize tournaments that could be anything from a basketball tourney to an esports one. 

The App works like this: A user organizes the tournament setting whether it's single elimination, double, or round robin. Another user signs up to participate to any tournament currently available. The organizer then updates the app according to the win/loss state of the participants in the tournament and each participant can check their place in the tournament.
